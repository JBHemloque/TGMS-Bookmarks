# TGMS-Bookmarks
EDDiscovery plugin to make it easy to bookmark systems in Elite Dangerous

I wrote this for the Trans-Galactic Metallicity Survey, an attempt to determine metallicity of boxels in the Elite Dangerous galaxy. That project has specific requirements for scanning, requiring explorers to keep a list of the systems they scan in this manner. This plugin allows explorers to add a system to their EDDiscovery bookmarks list with a single keypress.

# Installation

Copy TGMS_Bookmarks.act to your EDDiscovery Actions directory (c:\Users\{user}\AppData\Local\EDDiscovery\Actions by default). Pressing Scroll Lock while EDDiscovery has focus will add a system bookmark to your bookmark list.
